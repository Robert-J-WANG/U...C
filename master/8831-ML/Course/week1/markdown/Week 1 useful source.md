    ##### Black Friday Sales Prediction

    The dataset contains demographic information for customers (including age, gender, marital status, location, and more) as well as product details and total purchase amounts. A training data set and a testing data set are available.

    ##### Million Song Analysis

    Use this subset of the Million Song Dataset to predict the release year of a song from its audio features. The songs are primarily commercial Western tracks dating from 1922 to 2011, although the dataset does not include any audio—it consists of derived features only.

    ##### Movie Recommendation Engine

    Netflix uses collaborative filtering as part of its complex recommendation system, and with the MovieLens Dataset. Collaborative filtering recommendation engines analyze user behavior/preferences and similarities between users to predict what users will like.

    ##### Speech Emotion Recognition

    In the Speech Emotion Recognition with Librosa project, you will process sound files using Librosa, sound file, and sklearn for the MLPClassifier to recognize emotion from sound files. 

    You will load and process sound files, perform feature extraction, and train the Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier model. The project will teach you the basics of audio processing so that you can advance into training a deep learning model to achieve better accuracy.

    ##### Naïve Bees: Deep Learning with Images

    you will build and train a deep learning model to distinguish between honey bees and bumble bees images. You will start with image and label data processing.
